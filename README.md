# Autonomous Mini Car :car: :construction:
## The project:
In this final assigment we focus on creat self driving car system using camera and few sensors.
The main goal is that the car can drive in a path and avoid hitting obstacles on the way.
<br />
### In this project we use:
1. modified RC-car with bluetooth control
2. simple android phone for camera and sensors
<br />

### The program:
build with python code that will locate the obstacles and the travel path for a smooth ride with minimal problems.
<br />
<br />

### Related Works:
In several related works we found, the researchers used the OpenCV library to identify a travel lane, road signs and obstacles.<br />
In addition, some of them used additional sensors to detect distance and collision.<br />
According to the output of the sensors and the detection of the movement, a state machine was run which controlled the commands to move the vehicle.
